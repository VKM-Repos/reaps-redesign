# REAPS

Welcome to the REAPS redesign project. The project is a redesign of the REAPS web application, [old REAPS](www.reaps.com.ng). The project is built using React, Typescript, TailwindCSS and Vite.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js: v21.6.1
- npm: Package manager for managing Project dependencies.

### Installation

1. Clone the Repository
``` bash
  git clone <repository-url>
  cd <project-directory>
```

2. Install dependencies

Use npm:
``` bash
  npm install
```

### Development

To start the development server, use:

``` bash
  npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and open the application in your default web browser. The server will automatically reload when you make changes to your code.

### Building for Production

To create a production build of the application, use:

``` bash
  npm run build
```

This will generate optimized and minified files in the dist directory.


### Available Scripts

In this project, you can run the following scripts:

- `dev`: Start the development server
- `build`: Create a production build

### Project Structure

- `src/`: Source code of the application.
- `public/`: Static assets
- `vite.config.ts`: Vite Configuration file
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration file
